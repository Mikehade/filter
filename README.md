# filter
This program is written in c language, it filters images from command line
It's part of a bigger project
I only worked on the helper.c file
It performs four basic functions on images grayscale, sepia, blur and reflect
How to use from command line
./filter -g folder/filename fileout name e.g if the file is image.bmp and in a folder of image
./filter -g image/image.bmp newimage.bmp
-g = grayscale
-b = blur
-r = reflect
-s = sepia
